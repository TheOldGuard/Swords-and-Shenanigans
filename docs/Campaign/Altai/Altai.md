# Altai - The Divine City

The Divine City of Altai, the capitol city of the [[Exalted Charge of Hoyon]] is a sprawling metropolis. Within its walls, it harbors both the divine and the depraved. The city is built both below and above a cliff several hundred feet high. The Upper City sits atop the cliff, its noble and important citizens overseeing the governing of the nation. In contrast, the Lower City lies below on the shore at the foot of the cliff, its packed streets full of danger and opportunity in equal measure.
