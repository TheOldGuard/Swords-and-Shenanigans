# The Baker

**Faction**: Revolutionary

The Baker is a renowned figure in the Lower City, known for committing daring heists and leaving baked goods behind as their calling card. His first name isn't known, however it is rumored that he is a descendent of House Lahn, a noble house which was dissolved when the [[Church of Hoyos]] seized control of the government.

He is said to have designs on overthrowing the government in [[Altai]] as they are doing a poor job of governing. There is a growing voice of discontent among the population of the Lower City which resonates with this sentiment.
