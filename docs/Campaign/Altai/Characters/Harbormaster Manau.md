# Harbormaster Manau

**Faction**: Altai official

Harbormaster Manau is the bureaucrat in charge of the vessels coming and going from the [[Port of Songs]]. He is a man accustomed to comfortable living, but who does not let those comforts distract him from the important and invaluable[^1] work he does.

His most pressing matter is finding the mysterious [[Baker]] and bringing him to justice.
