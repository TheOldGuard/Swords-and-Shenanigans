# Indexer Jashira

**Faction**: [[Librarians]]

Jashira is an Indexer of the [[Librarians]], a functionary responsible for discerning the practical application for the knowledge the Library accumulates.  She is a practicing sorceress, but fastidious in her care to prevent herself from becoming tainted by its misuse.  As is the case with most who practice sorcery, she is driven by a quest for power and understanding, often willing to indulge in morally questionable behavior to gain them.
