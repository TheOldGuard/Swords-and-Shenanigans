# Inspector Captain Soren

**Faction**: [[Jade Guard]]

Inspector Captain Soren is a mid-tier officer in the [[Jade Guard]]. His most recent credit was as the arresting officer in a string of disappearances in the Lower City, culminating in the elimination of a sinister cult. However, he has not personally taken credit for it, instead stating that it was all the work of Cobalt Sentinel Services.

He has expressed frustration at the Guards' inability or reticence to keep order and prevent crime.
