# Parat

**Faction**: [[Iron Tigers]]

Parat was the leaders of one of the [[Iron Tigers]]' claws operating in the eastern part of the Lower City. He picked a fight with the wrong sort of people, choosing to harass the party. They dropped a building in the Guild Ward down into the tunnels, then took Parat captive, then executed him later.
