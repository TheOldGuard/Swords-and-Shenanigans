# Parat

**Faction**: [[Iron Tigers]]

Parat was the leaders of one of the [[Iron Tigers]]' claws operating in the eastern part of the Lower City. He picked a fight with the wrong sort of people, choosing to harass the [[Shadowmere Protection Guild]]. They dropped Parat's safehouse in the Guild Ward down into the tunnels, then took him captive. He was later executed and his body disposed of in the bay near the [[Tideshrine]].
