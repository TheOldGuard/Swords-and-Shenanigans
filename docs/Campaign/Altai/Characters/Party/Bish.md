# Bish

**Alias**: Jorven Shadowbrook
**Faction**: [[Shadowmere Protection Guild]]

A scoundrel with a nose for treasure, deft hands, and always at least a few knives.

Originally from [[Bocentia]].
## Notable Abilities and Items

- Agile and hard to pin down with a tendency for valuables to make their way into his pockets. 
- Has an arguably supernatural sense of when valuables are in his vicinity. 
- Likes to make trophies of symbols of the rich and powerful. 
- While enjoying nigh ghostly successes as a thief having a tumble on jobs that are more boisterous are a diversion that he does no object to. 
- Bearing innumerable blades upon his person as well as a trusty set of lockpicks, he also carries items of an arcane origin; most notably boots that allow him to shift through a shadowy otherworld at the risk of further corruption and an armband that provides a boon to resisting magical effects. 
- With a humble upbringing it has ever been his goal to acquire enough wealth that he might never see where he started from atop the pile. Though now as magical corruption continues to warp his body and mind he now also seeks a better understanding of the powerful beings that are often the sources of these abilities.
