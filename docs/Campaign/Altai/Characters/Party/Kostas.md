## Notable Abilities and Items

- Trained soldier with precognitive abilities that developed when he lost his sight that allow him to avoid attacks against him and turn attacks back against his enemies.
- Kostas’s martial training included learning how to defend others around him, particularly through moving into the path of oncoming enemies and making it difficult for them to move past him without paying for it.
- Kostas can fight despite his blindness, though this does limit his awareness beyond a close range. He can also move through areas where others’ vision is obscured with less difficulty.
- Kostas is a mage, but only recently accepted the role.  His use of magical abilities is primarily intuitive even though he has now started to attempt to control it directly.
- Kostas has the ability to cause others “bad luck” often leading to injury so long as he is holding his staff. This is also what allows him to occasionally turn away an attack that otherwise would have made it past his danger sense.
- Kostas can learn about an object, its function, and potentially its history simply by touching it. This information can be unclear at times, since he will see visions that must then be interpreted.
- Kostas can see magically despite his blindness and much of his divination magic works through these otherworldly senses and “sight” (see Corruption below as well)
- Kostas has recently learned how to “pull” on strings of magical energy connecting objects and individuals to move them physically and hold them in place.
- Kostas often speaks with a set of former companions who died during the incident that led to his blindness and his magical abilities.  These companions include:
	- Chokka – Scout
	- Beak – Rude Private (heckles a lot)
	- Kaelus – Hedge Wizard (magic lore expert Kostas consults when needing to better understand something about magic)
	- Aldus – Timid Messenger
	- Mindaral – Corporal (Know-It-All)
	- Mineaus – Field Medic
	- Ildos – Adjutant
- Kostas used to enjoy woodworking and has recently rediscovered the hobby.
- Kostas’s time on the streets as a beggar has allowed him to develop skills at gathering information just by listening to snippets of conversation and rumors.
