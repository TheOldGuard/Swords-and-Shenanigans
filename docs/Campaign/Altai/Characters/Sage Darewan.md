# Sage Darewan

**Faction**: [[Church of Hoyos]]

Sage Darewan is among the highest echelon of the [[Church of Hoyos]]. He serves as the administrative official of the Tsetser Diaconate, the region in which [[Altai]] resides. His wealth, power, and deft political acumen have served him well among the Council of Sages, maneuvering him into position to claim the Church's highest office should anything happen to [[Grand Sage Aranya]]. 

Through multiple run-ins and surveillance, the party has determined that Darewan is more than willing to partake in vile sorcery to achieve his ends. He seems to be working toward gaining power or information in order to prevent some unknown prophecy from coming true. However, the lengths to which he has proven himself willing to go are troubling to say the least.

> Darewan sits in his office, poring over tomes, parchment strewn across his desk. Suddenly, he stiffens, his head jerks up, screaming toward the ceiling. With an agonized cry, shadowy wings burst forth through his ornate robes of office. He slumps forward, gasping, as a scholarly figure across from him looks on in horror.
