# Sage Darewan

**Faction**: [[Church of Hoyos]]

Sage Darewan is among the highest echelon of the [[Church of Hoyos]]. His wealth, power, and deft political acumen have served him well among the Council of Sages, maneuvering him into position to claim the office of Grand Sage should anything happen to [[Grand Sage Aranya]]. 

The party has infiltrated his Upper City manor in the past, and found evidence that Darewan might be dabbling in vile sorcery, and may even be involved in the curse shared by Rargain and Bish.

> ***From the notes of Bish:***
> 
> "in possession of a book that Rargain had previously lost as well as an item that had previously belonged to Bish."
