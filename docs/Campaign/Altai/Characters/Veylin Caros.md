# Veylin Caros

**Faction**: Unaffiliated

Veylin Caros owns and operates Caros Curios, a discreet but well-appointed establishment tucked between a perfumerâ€™s shop and a jeweler in the Upper City. His clientele includes nobles seeking rare conversation pieces, scholars hunting lost knowledge, and the occasional individual with a taste for the macabre.

His rich clothing and heavily ringed fingers very much play into the image of the successful businessman, while his silvering hair and monocle give the impression of a man who knows things that you do not. The latter is helped along by the knowing smile he often wears.

He is known for being able to spin a believable tale about every item in his collection, though whether the story is true is up to interpretation. He deals in secrets as well as artifacts, and although the stories regarding his wares may be suspect, the information he sells has a reputation for its value and veracity.
