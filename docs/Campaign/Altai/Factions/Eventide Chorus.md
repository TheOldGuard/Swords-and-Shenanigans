# Eventide Chorus

The Eventide Chorus is a mysterious cult which dabbles in the vilest of sorceries. He Who Calls, the entity to which the cult is dedicated, is presumed by many to be a powerful being of Chaos.

> ***The Beckoning** - Hymn found in an Eventide Chorister's prayer book*
> 
> The Voices, guided by radiant whispers, strove toward the Unknown.
> 
> They beckoned!
> 
> In His embrace, the Chorus found its harmony within the cosmic flows. In fervent faith, they sang.
> 
> Oh, how it resonated! The Eventide thrummed with the Twilight's Call. The mysteries drew nearer, the veils growing thin.
> 
> They beckoned!
> 
> But intricate is the Song, inumerable are its harmonies. The Voices sang out, but their harmonies were not pure.
> 
> And yet they beckoned!
> 
> The Song, full of hope, grew somber, then jealous. It claimed the Voices who sang it.
> 
> But rejoice! For the Voices yet live Between, now whispering in the Between-Times.
> 
> They beckon!
> 
> Still the Caller calls, he beckons!
> 
> Nearer to Twilight they stand, conduits to its Glorious Call. Instruments of the Caller's Opus.
> 
> The faithful shall take their place in the Chorus, and The Winds of Every Where shall carry forth their Song of Beckoning.
> 
> Let every mind hear the reverberating wisdom of He Who Calls!
> 
> Let Twilight hear the Call and echo in return.
> 
> Let Eventide fall!
> 
> WE BECKON!
