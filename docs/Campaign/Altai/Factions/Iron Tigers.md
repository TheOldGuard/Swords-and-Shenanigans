# Iron Tigers

![[Iron Tigers.png|200]]

The Iron Tigers are apex predators of organized crime within the Lower City. They have their claws deeply embedded in the underbelly of Altai, thriving on protection rackets, extortion schemes, and tribute paid by smaller organizations.

They have recently experienced some setbacks, resulting in some of their subordinate gangs rising up and getting notions of independence.

The Tigers are organized into a number of Claws, each run by a trusted lieutenant.
