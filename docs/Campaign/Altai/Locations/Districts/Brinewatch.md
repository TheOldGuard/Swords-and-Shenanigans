# Brinewatch

**In:** [[Altai#The Lower City|Lower City]]

Brinewatch is a poor housing district within the Lower City. It lies outside the old walls of Altai in the newer, more marshy part of the city. Unfortunately for its residents, its view of the sea is completely obscured by the tall seawall and tall watchtowers (the namesakes of the district).
