# Port of Songs

**In:** [[Altai#The Lower City|Lower City]]

The Port of Songs is Altai's older and busier port. Most goods shipped to and from the [[Exalted Charge of Hoyon]] flow through the Port of Songs, save for the products of Altai's industry. Although it is one of the safest districts in the Lower City, wise guests would still remain vigilant here.
