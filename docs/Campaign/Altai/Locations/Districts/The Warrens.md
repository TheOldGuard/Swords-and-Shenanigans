# The Warrens

**In:** [[Altai#The Lower City|Lower City]]

The Warrens began as a shanty town camped outside the southern gate of Altai, but has since grown into the worst slums in the Lower City. Although the new wall keeps the Warrens safe from wildlife, the lack of [[Jade Guard]] presence has resulted in an area packed tightly with desperate people, full to bursting with poverty and crime in equal measure.

If anyone can be said to be in charge in The Warrens, it would likely be the Rat Syndicate. They rule the streets, as much as anyone could possibly be said to here, on behalf of the [[Iron Tigers]].
