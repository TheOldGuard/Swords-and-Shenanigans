# Drowon - The Contested Westlands

The largest contiguous landmass in Eldoria, Drowon is home to a variety of peoples. Due to its rich resources and diverse peoples, central Drowon is highly contested.

## Geography

The northern lands of The [[Novian Khaganate]] are primarily steppes and grasslands. The Choloul mountains divide the steppes from the southern lands, mostly grasslands with several lush forests.

Central Drowon is controlled by The [[Republic of Uming]] and The [[Exalted Charge of Hoyon]]. The land surrounding the Tenger Sea is comprised of savannah and desert scrublands with a few tropical and deciduous forests near the inner coast. The southeastern coast of the region is almost entirely rainforest.

The southern end of the continent is controlled mostly by the [[Trinella Federation]], although [[Bocentia]] controls the highly sought Aureus Bay and its mineral-rich hills. The fertile grassland plateau of [[Trinella Federation|Trinella]] serves as the breadbasket of southern and central Drowon.

## Cultures and Politics
There are three major cultural groups in Drowon: 
- The [[Taishar|Taishari]] people, who make up The [[Novian Khaganate]], [[Republic of Uming]], and The [[Kleiean Confederacy]], control the northern 2/3 of the continent.
- The [[Arare]] nations of [[Trinella Federation|Trinella]] and [[Bocentia]] control 2/3 of the southern third of the continent.
- The [[Quang]] people have only one nation comprised mostly of their own culture, the [[Exalted Charge of Hoyon]], which controls a relatively narrow band of territory.
