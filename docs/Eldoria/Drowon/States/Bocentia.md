# Bocentia

Bocentia is the southern-most nation on the continent of [[Drowon|Drowon]]. Its people are primarily [[Arare]], though there is a sizeable [[Edrin]] presence. This presence is due to Bocentia's status as a [[Empire of Shanar|Shanarian]] protectorate. While the [[Empire of Shanar|Empire]] mostly leaves Bocentia to its own affairs, they do have certain trade agreements which are as important to the [[Edrin|Edrinel]] as they are mysterious to everyone but the highest echelon of Bocentian government.

Were it not for the [[Empire of Shanar|Shanarians]], Bocentia would have long ago been conquered by the [[Trinella Federation]]. Its industrial capacity is abnormally high due to the rich mineral resources in the Bocentian hills.  Bocentia's capitol, Vencuri, commands the Aureus Bay, so named for the gold mines in the surrounding area.
