# Duchy of Contia

Off the southeastern coast of [[Drowon|Drowon]], the Duchy of Contia is most known for its navy and its merchant fleets. The dense jungle of the Contian interior make for excellent ship-building material.

Due to the Duchy's focus on trade, it is more diverse than many other nations in Drowon. The [[Arare]] make up slightly more than half of the population, with the remaining half being a mix of peoples from Drowon and more eastern lands.
