# Exalted Charge of Hoyon

The Exalted Charge of Hoyon is a theocratic nation devoted to [[Hoyonism|The Divine Hoyos]], god of wisdom and order. Although most of Hoyon's population is primarily of [[Quang]] descent, its capitol, [[Altai]] is one of the most diverse cities in the world.

The Charge's highest religious and civic offices are held by the Sages, each subordinate only to the Grand Sage, who rules from the Utmost Pinnacle of [[Altai]].
