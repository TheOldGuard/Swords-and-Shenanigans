# Drowon - The Contested Land

The largest contiguous landmass in Eldoria, Drowon is home to a variety of peoples. Due to its rich resources and diverse peoples, central Drowon is highly contested.

## Geography

The northern lands of The [[Novian Khaganate]] are primarily steppes and grasslands. The Choloul mountains divide the steppes from the southern lands, mostly grasslands with several lush forests.

Central Drowon is controlled by The [[Republic of Uming]] and The [[Exalted Charge of Hoyon]]. The land surrounding the Tenger Sea is comprised of savannah and desert scrublands with a few tropical and deciduous forests near the inner coast. The southeastern coast of the region is almost entirely rainforest.

The southern end of the continent is controlled mostly by the [[Trinella Federation]], although [[Bocentia]] controls the highly sought Aureus Bay and its mineral-rich hills. The fertile grassland plateau of [[Trinella Federation|Trinella]] serves as the breadbasket of southern and central Drowon.

## Cultures and Politics
There are three major cultural groups in Drowon: 

- The [[Taishar|Taishari]] people, who make up The [[Novian Khaganate]], [[Republic of Uming]], and The [[Kleian Confederacy]], control the northern 2/3 of the continent.
- The [[Arare]] nations of [[Trinella Federation|Trinella]] and [[Bocentia]] control 2/3 of the southern third of the continent.
- The [[Quang]] people have only one nation comprised mostly of their own culture, the [[Exalted Charge of Hoyon]], which controls a relatively narrow band of territory.
## Politics

  The continent is currently held by eight nations, or nine if you count the large island off the southern coast.
  
  - [[Novian Khaganate]] - ancestral home of the Taishar people, who once ruled all of Drowon (according to them)
  - [[Kleian Confederacy]] - City-states occupying the tundra and cold grasslands mid-continent, mostly Taishari
  - [[Republic of Uming]] - Taishari with some Quang influence. Historically uneasy relations with [[Exalted Charge of Hoyon|Hoyon]]
  - [[Exalted Charge of Hoyon]] - Theocracy dedicated to [[Hoyonism]], home of the [[Quang]] people
  - [[Trinella Federation]] - [[Arare]] nation, run by trade organizations, chiefly exports grain. Known for corruption.
  - [[Bocentia]] - controls Aureus Bay and its mineral-rich hills from their capitol, Vencuri. Considered a protectorate of  [[Empire of Shanar|The Empire of Shanar]]. Arare, with some Eldrinel influence
  - [[Duchy of Contia]] - The small island off the coast of Trinella and Bocentia, known for its navy and merchant fleets.
