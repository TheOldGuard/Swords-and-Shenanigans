# Edrin

The Edrin (plural - Edrinel) people are one of the several unnatural peoples of Eldoria. Millenia ago, the [[Empire of Shanar]] dabbled with the powers of Chaos in order to extend their lives and improve their memories. They live for centuries without aging once they reach adulthood, so in that way, they succeeded.

Being long-lived, the Edrinel have a rather unique perspective on things. Impatience is rare among them, at least until they get older. Although the ancient Shanarians altered themselves and their offspring to be nearly immortal, their dabbling revealed a weakness they were not able to overcome. 

The more ancient an Edrin grows, the more cognitive quirks they develop. While their enhanced memory grants them exceptional capacity for learning information, it also makes it nearly impossible for them to forget or gloss over negative experiences. The accumulation of emotional trauma manifests as a growing inventory of mental health issues.

The Edrinel once ruled every continent of Eldoria. However, as the ruling dynasty of [[Empire of Shanar|Shanar]] aged, they grew quite mad. The empire slowly deteriorated and was pushed back, their client nations overthrowing their increasingly erratic rule.

Outside of their traditional homelands, Edrinel are relatively rare, usually only found in small pocket communities in rural or unpopulated areas. There are a few exceptions to this general rule. Edrin from [[Cenorlor]] are often seen among the [[Angian Tribelands|Angian Tribes]] they sponsor. [[Empire of Shanar|Shanarians]] help defend [[Bocentia]] from their neighbors' advances.
