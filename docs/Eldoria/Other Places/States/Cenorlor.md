# Cenorlor Republic

The final (or at least most recent) piece of the [[Empire of Shanar]] to secede. Considered "wild" by many, the core value of most Cenorlorans is freedom at any cost. 

Cenorlor is notable in that it is the only nation, apart from [[Empire of Shanar|Shanar]] to be comprised of primarily [[Edrin]] citizenry.
