# Gasalia

Gasalia is an island nation which lies between the [[Angian Tribelands]] and [[Drowon]]. As an island nation, it comes as no surprise that they are a seafaring people. Their location affords them an excellent opportunity for trade and arbitrage.

They also have certain diplomatic and trade agreements with the [[Angian Tribelands|Angian Tribes]], which has granted them territory on an Angian peninsula.

> In our world, we would recognize their culture as similar to that of several western European nations, particularly England or Portugal during the age of exploration.
