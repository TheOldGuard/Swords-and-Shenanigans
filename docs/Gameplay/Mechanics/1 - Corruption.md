# Coruption

Chaos presses against veil of the mortal realm, its denizens seeking to bring forth entropy and madness. When a mortal is touched by the powers of Chaos, whether inadvertently or intentionally, they risk being corrupted by the experience.

## Gaining Corruption

Magic is volatile and warps its practitioners as well as those who come into contact with it. Corruption is everywhere.

1. When directed to do so, make a Miraculous Save to avoid the effects of Chaos. Gain a Bane on this roll for every 5 Corruption you have. **You may choose to voluntarily fail this Save.**
2. If you fail, roll 1d20 and add your current Corruption score to the roll. Compare the result to the table below.
3. Whether you succeeded or failed on the Save above, gain one point of Corruption.

## The Consequences of Magic

Invoking the powers of Chaos is risky business, and the more power you reach for, the higher the risk.

You automatically gain 1 Corruption when you:

- Cast a spell at Power Level 3, whether you succeed or not.
- Cast a spell at Power Level 2 and you fail to overcome resistance, or the spell fizzles due to 1s being rolled.

Additionally, you may dig deeper into the power in order to stave off Spell Burn. When you do so, instead of taking 1 Strike of damage, you take 1 Corruption.

In all of the above cases, you must make a Corruption save as normal.

## Corruption Effects

When you fail to save against Corruption, roll 1d20 and add your ***current*** Corruption score to the result. If your result is one you already have, reroll until you get a new one.

The Effect manifests immediately, and is permanent unless otherwise specified.

If you ever gain 5 Effects from the same Aspect (e.g. you have 5 Demon Aspects), you are overcome by Corruption and your soul, mind, and body are warped appropriately to the type of Aspect you have 5 of. Your character immediately becomes an NPC nemesis to your party.
