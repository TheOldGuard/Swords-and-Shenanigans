# Usage Dice

Usage Dice are d6 which represent a finite supply of something. They can represent the time before a potion spoils, the arrows remaining in your quiver, or even something abstract like the amount of abstract preparation the part had time to do before their current adventure.

When doing an activity which would interact with a pool of usage dice (e.g. firing one of the arrows mentioned above), the GM will tell you to roll a number of Usage Dice (UD). When rolling UD, any dice which roll 1 or 2 are depleted and removed from the pool.

For example, if you have 3UD worth of arrows and fire a huge volley into massed enemies, the GM might have you roll 2UD. The dice roll 3 and 1. The 1 is depleted, but the 3 is not. Therefore, you now have 2UD worth of arrows.
