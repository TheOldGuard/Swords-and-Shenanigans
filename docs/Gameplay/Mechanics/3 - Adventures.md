# Adventures

There are different types of adventures your characters might undertake. Some are prepared in advance by the GM with minimal player input. Think of these types of adventures as curated experiences. Other adventures might be prepared in advance based on player input ahead of time. Still others might be built on the fly based on the parameters the GM and players agree upon.
## Preparation and Flashbacks

Regardless of the type of adventure you undertake, you may have time to prepare ahead of time. Rather than spending time at the table discussing all the ways in which things might go horribly wrong and trying to account for them, we use flashbacks to explain how your characters foresaw their current obstacle and prepared for it accordingly. Maybe they made sure to bring a shovel because they anticipated the need to dig. Or maybe they knew the High Priest had a particular fondness for Angian meade and acquired a nice bottle as a bribe.
### How To Flashback

State what you want the flashback to entail and what you hope to accomplish with it. Describe the activity you took before the Adventure began, being as cinematic as you feel is warranted. The GM will tell you how many Preparation Dice you need to roll for that flashback, based on how unlikely or difficult it would be.
### Rolling the Prep Dice

Preparation Dice are simply [[2 - Usage Dice|Usage Dice]], and are rolled as such, with one notable exception - when the pool is smaller than the needed roll.  If you do NOT have enough Preparation DIce as determined by the GM, roll as many as you can, then you may reroll dice which weren't spent (didn't roll a 1 or 2). If at any time you still need to roll more dice but you have none, your flashback failed to bear fruit. 

For example, let's say the party has 1 Preparation Die. John wants a flashback which the GM determines costs 3 Preparation Dice. John rolls 1 Prep Die, and gets a 3 (narrowly avoiding losing the die), leaving him with 1 PD rolled and 2 to go. He rolls a second time and gets a 4, leaving him at 2/3. He rolls a final time and gets a 2, consuming the last Prep Die, but successfully getting the flashback.

Imagine instead the second roll was a 1 or 2. In that case, he would have failed to get the flashback he wanted, because he was only able to roll 2 Prep Dice.

### Karma and Prep Dice

Karma and Hero Dice can be applied to Prep Dice if they could be applied to a normal roll in the same context. (e.g. no Karma on 1s, or if the flashback involves a lot of magic, but Hero Dice can still apply).
### Gaining Preparation Dice

The size of the shared pool of Prep Dice at the start of the adventure is determined by the degree of preparation the party has done before the adventure begins. The party starts with 2 Prep Dice if they complete the first degree of preparation, 4 Prep Dice for second degree, or 8 Prep Dice for the third degree.

The exact fictional circumstances determining what constitutes a "degree of preparation" can be discussed. It may be temporal or material in nature, or some other thing we need not think of ahead of time. For example, if strictly temporal, maybe the first degree is a day of preparation, the second degree is a week, and the third degree is a month (3 weeks).
## In-the-Dark Style Engagement

For some adventures, starting off with a loose framework of what the party's trying to accomplish, then filling in the rest with flashbacks and such is ideal. This is especially true for shorter, more direct adventures. This is a 2-step process: Approach and Engagement.

### Approach

The first step is to choose which Approach to use. There are six different Approaches, each with a missing detail you need to provide (see the list below). To “plan an operation,” choose the Approach and supply the detail. Then the GM will cut to the action as the first moments of the adventure unfold.

* Assault - do violence to a target.
  Detail: The point of attack
* Deception - Lure, trick or manipulate
  Detail: The method of deception
* Stealth - Trespass unseen.
  Detail: The point of infiltration
* Occult - Engage a supernatural power
  Detail: The arcane method
* Social - Negotiate, bargain, or persuade
  Detail: The social connection
* Transport : Carry cargo or people through danger
  Detail: The route & means

### The Detail 

When you choose a plan, you provide a missing detail, like the point of attack, social connection, etc. If you don’t know the detail, you can gather information in some way to discover it.

### Engagement

Once you have the plan and detail chosen, make a fortune roll (a la BitD), modified as follows:

* Is the operation particularly bold or daring? Take +1d.
* Is it overly complex or contingent on many factors? Take -1d
* Does the detail expose a vulnerability of the target or hit them where they're weakest? Take +1d.
* Is the target strongest against this approach or do they have particular defenses or special preparations? Take -1d
* Can any of your friends or contacts provide aid or insight for this operation? Take +1d
* Are any enemies or rivals interfering in the operation? Take -1d
* Are there any other elements that you want to consider? +/-1d as necessary

### Results

* **Critical** (more than one 6 is rolled): Exceptional result. You've already overcome the first obstacle and you're in good shape to face what's next.
* **6**: Good result. You're in good shape to face what's next.
* **4/5**: Mixed result. The situation could go either way when the action starts
* **1-3**: Bad result. Things are not going your way when the action starts.
