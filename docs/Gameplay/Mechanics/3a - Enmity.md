# Enmity

Enmity is a measure of how much friction the party is causing with other groups or individuals within the city. The higher the party's Enmity, the more likely they are to experience serious complications as a result of their activities.

## Gaining Enmity

Altai is full of eyes and ears. All of the major players have informants and spies all over the city. For anything that party does, word will usually get back to people who would very much care to know. The more you upset the status quo, and the more visible you are while doing it, the larger the potential blowback will be.

Enmity is gained according to the nature of the adventures they undertake and the degree of visibility there is on the party's activities:

- 0 Enmity: Smooth & quiet; Nobody knows, or those who know don't care.
- 2 Enmity: Contained; Minimal friction with people who would be opposed
- 4 Enmity: Loud & Chaotic; People saw or heard. People know it was you.
- 6 Enmity: Wild; Everybody knows it was you and are talking about it.

Gain +1 Enmity for a high-profile or well-connected target. Gain +1 Enmity if the adventure was in hostile turf. Gain +1 Enmity if you're at war with another faction. Gain +2 Enmity if killing was involved (whether you did the killing or not. People talk about bodies).

## Consequences

As the PCs incur more Enmity, the [[5a - Complications|Complications]] which arise from their actions will become more severe. Once Enmity reaches 10, the story will reach a tipping point. There will be a Major Shift within the Lower City, balancing the scales against the party on a grand scale.

Major Shifts will be recorded, and will escalate Complications until their effects are righted or no longer relevant.  For example, if the Major Shift resulted in the Jade Guard placing a standing bounty on the heads of the PCs, Complication rolls would be escalated for as long as the bounty stands.
