# Economy

Micromanaging how many gold marks, silver moons, or copper pennies your character is carrying around with you can be fun, but this game is not focused on that aspect of the Brazen life. Instead of individual amounts of coins to keep track of, throughout your adventures you may acquire Coinpurses, abstract representations of money. Coinpurses can be used for many things, such as buying [[5 - Downtime|Downtime]] dice, improving Downtime activity results, or of course, buying things.

### Wealth

Aside from Coinpurses, which represent your pocket money, you have a level of Wealth. Your Wealth represents your overall economic position, and determines how easily you can afford things. Your Wealth can improve throughout the course of your adventures by various means. If you have sufficient Coinpurses (as indicated by the table below), you can buy your way up. The exact amount of coinpurses depends on what level you're trying to buy, and not all levels of wealth are within reach of simply saving up your money.

| Level | Description   | Cost to Achieve                                                                                 |
| ----- | ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1     | Pauper        | Free (most Brazen start here)                                                                   |
| 2     | Cash Poor     | 5 Coinpurses                                                                                    |
| 3     | Moderate      | 10 Coinpurses                                                                                   |
| 4     | Wealthy       | 20 Coinpurses and describe what you do to maintain this wealth (start a business, invest, etc.) |
| 5     | Lordly Wealth | Cannot be bought. Must be a narrative result.                                                   |
| 6     | Kingly Wealth | Unlikely to be achievable except through extraordinary means.                                   |

### Buying Things

When you want to buy something, the GM will determine the cost level of the item. If the cost level is equal to or above that of your Wealth level, you and the GM will roll to determine if you can afford the item. The GM will roll a number of d6 equal to the cost level. You will then roll any number of dice up to your wealth level. Instead of Karma, you may improve your result by spending Coinpurses 1 for 1.

If your result is:

* LESS THAN the GM's roll, they can't afford the item.
* EQUAL TO the GM's roll, they can purchase the item but lose a wealth level
* GREATER THAN the GM's roll, they can purchase the item.

If you roll any 1s, some fictional complication will arise from the purchase. Maybe someone saw you flashing around bags of coins, or maybe a rival sees the purchase going down and catch wind of the party's plans. As always, 1s cannot be influenced by Coinpurses, but may be rerolled using Hero Dice.
