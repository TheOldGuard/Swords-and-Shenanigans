# Downtime

Between adventures, we have an opportunity to see what the PCs are like when they aren't all together, facing down some life-or-death situation. We get a glimpse into what makes each character tick, and what sorts of things are important to them.

## Downtime Dice

Everyone gets a certain amount of dice to use during Downtime. The amount depends on how many players are present and how much "meat" we want to have in that downtime session. If you run out of downtime dice, you can buy them with [[4 - Economy|Coinpurses]], 1 for 1.

When it is your turn, you can spend as many of these dice as you want (minimum 1d) on a given activity.

Add the spent dice with any Boons you might otherwise have for the action you're taking, then roll. The results of the roll vary depending on the specific type of activity. Generally, a 1-3 either does not accomplish what you're trying to accomplish or isn't very effective, a 4-5 is moderate success (possibly with a trade-off of some sort), a 6 is success, and if you get multiple 6s, it is critically successful.

If any 1s are rolled, a complication arises. Hero dice may be used as normal to reroll 1s.

Karma cannot be used for downtime activities. Instead, you can explain how you were able to leverage your material assets to improve the result. In this way, Coinpurses may be used to improve the level of success by one category per Coinpurse spent.  For example if you roll a 2, you can spend 1 Coinpurse to increase the result to the 4-5 range, and another to raise it again to a 6 result. However, like with Karma, if the highest die result is a 1, Coinpurses cannot be used to improve the result of that die.

## Working Together

Multiple PCs may work together toward a given goal. Each PC can spend as many downtime dice as they wish on the roll. Much like with any other situation, the characters might be taking different actions to achieve a common goal, so each character may add Boons (or Banes) according to the kind of action they wish to take.

For example, Alice and Bob want to work together to research a new alchemical formula for an upcoming adventure (a long-term project). Alice spends two downtime dice to conduct experiments. Her alchemical aptitude (an Asset) gives her a Boon on these experiments. She rolls a total of 3d6 (two downtime plus one Boon).

Meanwhile, Bob is spending time (and one downtime die) at the university library, poring through thick and dusty tomes of alchemical lore. His Skald Hero Path gives him a Boon on Lore-related tasks, so he has a total of 2d6 on his roll.

They both roll their pools of dice, then take the highest result among them. Working together increases the likelihood of success, but also increases the chance of complications.

> ***Note:** As written, working together is inefficient in most cases. For example, let's say you are working together on a long-term project. One player spends 2 dice and gets (2 5). The other player spends one die and has a Boon and gets (1 6). The result is 6, two Progress. However, if they'd each rolled separately, they would have ended up with 3 total Progress because the first player got a 5. It is narratively interesting, but not mechanically beneficial unless the cost of failure is high.*

## Enmity

While not specifically a Downtime mechanic, Enmity has a very real effect on what you may choose to do, and the consequences thereof. Enmity is a measure of how much friction the party is causing with other groups or individuals within the city. As the PCs incur more Enmity, the complications which arise from their actions will become more severe. Once Enmity reaches 10, something will shift within the Lower City, further balancing the scales against the party on a grand scale.
## Downtime Activities

You can spend your downtime dice doing just about anything you can think of. Some of your options are listed below, but it NOT meant to be an exhaustive list.

### Long-Term Projects

Some things take time and effort to complete. Developing a new alchemical compound, learning a new skill, or building up a network of informants are all examples of things which may take days, weeks, or possibly even months to complete. In the game, these are represented by Long-Term Projects.

When a project begins, the GM and player will work together to figure out what the end state of the project is. Using the alchemy example, once the project is done, the party can start making the new alchemical compound for use in their adventures. Once the end state is decided, the GM will determine how much progress is needed to complete the project.

At that point, and each time someone works on the project, they spend a number of downtime dice, and describe what they are doing to further the project toward completion. Depending on what sort of actions they are taking, they may gain Banes or Boons on the roll.

They will then roll their pool of dice and read the results as follows:

* 1-3:Not effective at furthering your goal.
* 4/5: Moderately helpful (1 progress)
* 6: Effective (2 progress)
* Crit: 2+1 progress (see below)

On a critical success, in addition to gaining 2 progress toward the project you're working on, you can either take 1 more progress on this project, OR apply 1 progress toward a different one, so long as you can describe how it was achieved based on what you were doing. This other project need not necessarily be "yours" so long as you aren't stepping on someone else's toes.

### Reduce Enmity

You can reduce the amount of Enmity the party has in Altai any number of ways. Describe what your character does to diffuse the ill will others may have toward the party (or possibly shirk that dislike onto someone else). Then decide how many downtime dice to spend, add any relevant Boons, and roll.

You reduce the party's Enmity by an amount determined by the roll:

* 1-3: one
* 4/5: two
* 6: three
* Crit: five.

### Show Us Who You Are

Sometimes you might spend downtime dice on doing something which doesn't have any purpose aside from showing or exploring who your character is when they're not being Brazen. Describe what your character is doing, who they're meeting up with, etc. Roll as normal, then gain a benefit as follows:

* 1-3: Immediately gain 1 Karma. You may "buy trouble" to gain 1 XP as well.
* 4-5: Gain 1 XP
* 6: Gain 2 XP OR Gain 1 XP and A: add 1 progress to a project, or B: reduce the party's Enmity by 1. Explain how. 
* Crit: As a 6, but you gain 2 XP as well as either 1 progress or -1 Enmity.

### Go Shopping

If you spend Downtime Dice going shopping for something you need, this represents spending extra time and effort making or finding a good deal. When you roll to [[4 - Economy#Buying Things|buy something]], add your expended Downtime Dice to the pool.
