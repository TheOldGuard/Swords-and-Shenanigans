When a downtime activity roll includes 1s, a complication arises. The complication need not necessarily be related to the activity whose roll triggered it. The party has a vast web of contacts, relationships, and rivals who may come to the fore with an issue that needs addressing.

When a complication is called for, roll on the following table. Choose the appropriate column based on the amount of [[3a - Enmity|Enmity]] the party has. Roll 1d6, plus 1d6 for each active Major Shift, and take the highest die.

| d6  | 0-3 Enmity | 4-5 Enmity | 6+ Enmity |
| --- | ---------- | ---------- | --------- |
| 1-3 | TBD        | TBD        | TBD       |
| 4-5 | TBD        | TBD        | TBD       |
| 6   | TBD        | TBD        | TBD       |
