# Experience and Advancement

Throughout a character's adventures, he will undoubtedly learn new skills or hone existing ones. Over time, he will become more effective at the things to which he devotes his time and attention.  Through play, player characters will earn XP, which may be spent during [[5 - Downtime|Downtime]] in order to gain advancements.

For entirely new skills or abilities, you will need to have a narrative justification for it. For example, you might spend a number of [[5 - Downtime|Downtime]] actions working on a long-term project to learn a new skill. Or you might just find a relic that grants a new ability, or a Corruption effect that does so, beforehand.

The important thing is that advancements which add new things to the palette need to have a basis in the fiction before you can pick them up.
