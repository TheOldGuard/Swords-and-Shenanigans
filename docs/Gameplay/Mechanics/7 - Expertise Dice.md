# Expertise Dice

Through spending [[6 - Experience and Advancement|XP]], you can gain a pool of Expertise Dice, which allow you to accomplish even more impressive feats.  These dice reset each session like Karma and Hero Dice do.  You also regain one Expertise Die after a full night's rest, or through particularly notable deeds determined by the GM. There are several ways that Expertise Dice may be used.
## Post-Hoc Boons

You can spend an Expertise Die to add a die to any roll you make, and you need not decide to do so until after you see the result. This is like getting a boon on the roll after it already happened. You may repeat this as many times as you like, until you are satisfied with the roll, or you run out of Expertise Dice.

If your Expertise Dice cause you to succeed at a roll you would have otherwise failed, describe the difficulty of what you just accomplished, and how your experience and training allowed you to overcome it where someone else would have thwarted.

> Note! Unlike Hero Dice, Expertise Dice are ADDED to the pool, they do not replace dice in the pool. This means that any 1s (or 2s in the case of [[2 - Usage Dice|Usage Dice]]) remain.

## Expert Insight

You can spend an Expertise Die to gain insight or advantage in a tense spot. Ask a question and the GM will answer it as completely as possible, given the context of your character's knowledge and experience, and will tie that revelation into the story as something your character notices or realizes.

## Hard-Earned Grit

You can, once per round, trade Expertise Dice for Karma or a Hero Die. This reflects the grit and determination (or just overall skill) you have gained over time.

- Buy 2 Karma for 1 Expertise Die
- Buy a Hero Die for 2 Expertise Dice
