# Getting Started 

At the start of each session, we will do the following things, in order:

1. Character Highlights
2. Read Player Principles
3. Recap

## 1 -  Character Highlights

Each character has an ever-growing list of cool things they can do. Each player will take turns choosing 1-3 capabilities, quirks, or equipment they would like to have an opportunity to highlight on screen during the session.

## 2 - Read Player Principles

- Be Brazen. Embrace the pulp.
- Be creative with what you've got.
- Ask questions to help everyone understand the situation.
- Be open about your goals and intentions. The "why" is more useful than the "what."
- The GM is always honest. Characters played by them may or may not be.
- Hero Dice and Karma reset each session. Use them to do cool stuff!
- Be ambitious. Set goals. Earn your reputation. Pull the lever.
- Show your Corruption on screen.
- Play with your party, not just alongside them.
- Go into danger, fall in love with trouble. Don't be afraid to make things worse.
- Play your character to the bloody hilt.

## 3 - Recap

Who remembers what happened last time?
