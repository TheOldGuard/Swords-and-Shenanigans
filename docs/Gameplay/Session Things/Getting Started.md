# Getting Started 

At the start of each session, we will do the following things, in order:

1. Character Flags
2. Read Player Principles
3. Gain 1XP for being here
4. Recap

## 1 -  Character Flags

Each [[Shadowmere Protection Guild|party member]] has one or more [Flags](https://a-dungeon-world.fandom.com/wiki/Flags), signposts for others to interact with them in a way that lets them showcase an important aspect of the character. Take turns going over each character's flag(s).

At the [[Wrapping Up|end of the session]], you will gain XP for Flag hits (bonus XP if everyone had at least one of their flags hit)

## 2 - Read Player Principles

- Be Brazen. Embrace the pulp.
- Ask questions to help everyone understand the situation.
- Be open about your goals and intentions. The "why" is more useful than the "what."
- Hero Dice and Karma reset each session. Use them to do cool stuff!
- Be ambitious. Set goals. Earn your reputation. Pull the lever.
- Show your Corruption on screen.
- Play *with* your party, not just alongside them.
- Go into danger, fall in love with trouble. Don't be afraid to make things worse.
- Play your character to the bloody hilt.

## 3 - Gain 1XP

You are here. Gain 1XP.
## 4 - Recap
