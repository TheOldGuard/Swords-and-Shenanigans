# Getting Started 

At the start of each session, we will do the following things, in order:

1. Character Highlights
2. Read Player Principles
3. Recap

## 1 -  Character Highlights

Each [[Shadowmere Protection Guild|party member]] has an ever-growing list of cool things they can do.  Each player will take turns choosing 1 capability, quirk, or piece of equipment they would like to have an opportunity to highlight on screen during the session, as well as one for the person to go after them. The order will be determined randomly each session. The last player in order will choose something to highlight about the first player's character.

When choosing highlights, make it something both interesting and reasonable. If you hit your highlights, you get XP, and if it's a highlight someone else gave you, they get XP also!

## 2 - Read Player Principles

- Be Brazen. Embrace the pulp.
- Be creative with what you've got.
- Ask questions to help everyone understand the situation.
- Be open about your goals and intentions. The "why" is more useful than the "what."
- The GM is always honest. Characters played by them may or may not be.
- Hero Dice and Karma reset each session. Use them to do cool stuff!
- Be ambitious. Set goals. Earn your reputation. Pull the lever.
- Show your Corruption on screen.
- Play with your party, not just alongside them.
- Go into danger, fall in love with trouble. Don't be afraid to make things worse.
- Play your character to the bloody hilt.
