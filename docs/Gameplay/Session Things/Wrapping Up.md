# Wrapping Up

At the end of each session, we will do the following things, in order:

1. Character Highlights
2. Roses and Thorns

## 1 - Character Highlights

Go around the table and revisit the highlights set for each character at the start of the session. Did we hit them? If not, how can we do better next time?

## 2 - Roses and Thorns

We will go around the table twice. The first time, each person sharing a Thorn before passing the turn to someone else. The second round, each person shares a Rose.

### Thorns 

Thorns are something that we could do better. It's not a complaint, but instead constructive criticism. It gives us an opportunity to recognize themes, mechanics, or procedures we can improve to streamline the game for maximum fun.

### Roses

Roses are highlights of things we thought were awesome. Some examples of things which you might bring up as a rose:

- Someone did something really cool.
- Different bits of background story clicked together in an interesting way.
- There was a particularly delightful or surprising roleplaying interaction.
- You really liked the art or a mechanic that came up this session
- Literally anything else that boosted your enjoyment of the session
