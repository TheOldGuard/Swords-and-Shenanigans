# Wrapping Up

At the end of each session, we will do the following things, in order:

1. End-of-Session Questions
2. Character Highlights
3. Roses and Thorns

## 1 - End-of-Session Questions

As a group, answer the following questions:

- Did we learn something new and important about the world?
- Did we overcome a notable foe or gain a notable ally?
- Did the party gain notoriety, glory, or power?
- Did we try to make sure every character got opportunities to shine?
- Did we see most of the Player Principles in use?

If at least 3 of the answers were yes, everyone gains 1 XP.
## 2 - Character Flags

Look at each of the characters' Flags and do the following:

- If at least one of your character's Flags was hit, gain 1 XP
- If you hit at least one other character's Flag, gain 1 XP
- If every character had at least one of their Flags hit, gain 1 XP
## 3 - Roses and Thorns

We will go around the table twice. The first time, each person sharing a Thorn before passing the turn to someone else. The second round, each person shares a Rose.

### Thorns 

Thorns are something that we could do better. It's not a complaint, but instead constructive criticism. It gives us an opportunity to recognize themes, mechanics, or procedures we can improve to streamline the game for maximum fun.

### Roses

Roses are highlights of things we thought were awesome. Some examples of things which you might bring up as a rose:

- Someone did something really cool.
- Different bits of background story clicked together in an interesting way.
- There was a particularly delightful or surprising roleplaying interaction.
- You really liked the art or a mechanic that came up this session
- Literally anything else that boosted your enjoyment of the session
